<h2 class="alert alert-success">Congratulations, your <a class="alert-link" href="http://luminusweb.net">Luminus</a> site is ready!</h2>

This page will help guide you through the first steps of building your site.

#### Why are you seeing this page?

The `home-routes` handler in the `krueger.routes.home` namespace
defines the route that invokes the `home-page` function whenever an HTTP
request is made to the `/` URI using the `GET` method.

```
(defroutes home-routes
  (GET "/" []
       (home-page))
  (GET "/docs" []
       (-> (response/ok (-> "docs/docs.md" io/resource slurp))
           (response/header "Content-Type" "text/plain; charset=utf-8"))))
```

The `home-page` function will in turn call the `krueger.layout/render` function
to render the HTML content:

```
(defn home-page []
  (layout/render "home.html"))
```

The page contains a link to the compiled ClojureScript found in the `target/cljsbuild/public` folder:

```
{% script "/js/app.js" %}
```

The rest of this page is rendered by ClojureScript found in the `src/cljs/krueger/core.cljs` file.



#### Organizing the routes

The routes are aggregated and wrapped with middleware in the `krueger.handler` namespace:

```
(defstate app
  :start
  (middleware/wrap-base
    (routes
      (-> #'home-routes
          (wrap-routes middleware/wrap-csrf)
          (wrap-routes middleware/wrap-formats))
      (route/not-found
        (:body
          (error-page {:status 404
                       :title "page not found"}))))))
```

The `app` definition groups all the routes in the application into a single handler.
A default route group is added to handle the `404` case.

The `home-routes` are wrapped with two middleware functions. The first enables CSRF protection.
The second takes care of serializing and deserializing various encoding formats, such as JSON.

#### Managing your middleware

Request middleware functions are located under the `krueger.middleware` namespace.

This namespace is reserved for any custom middleware for the application. Some default middleware is
already defined here. The middleware is assembled in the `wrap-base` function.

Middleware used for development is placed in the `krueger.dev-middleware` namespace found in
the `env/dev/clj/` source path.

#### Database configuration is required

If you haven't already, then please follow the steps below to configure your database connection and run the necessary migrations.

* Create the database for your application.
* Update the connection URL in the `profiles.clj` file with your database name and login.
* Run `lein run migrate` in the root of the project to create the tables.
* Let `mount` know to start the database connection by `require`-ing `krueger.db.core` in some other namespace.
* Restart the application.
